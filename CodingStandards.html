        <ol>
            <li> All code should be stored in a single file named for the chapter in CLRS
                for which it implements the algorithms, OR it should be in a directory with
                such a name, if there is more than one file for the code. So, if the C source
                code for chapter 4 is in a single file, it should be called
                <i>divide_and_conquer.c</i>.
            <br>
            <br>
                If a directory is used, the directory should be named in mixed
                case: <i>DynamicProgramming</i>.

            <li> There should be a test for each algorithm implemented.

            <li> Code should reflect the pseudocode in CLRS "fairly" closely.
                How close depends greatly on the language being used for
                implementation. Clearly, an implementation in Lisp or
                a assembly language is not going to be as close to the
                textbook pseudocode as one in Pascal.

                The decision as to whether to use a "shortcut"
                provided by a language should be based on how crucial the code
                in question is to the algorithm. Clearly, we can't "implement"
                quicksort just by calling the library quicksort routine! But if
                the pseudocode is dividing an array into pieces for a
                divide-and-conquer algorithm, it is fine to use Python's
                slicing capability.

            <li> Code should print intermediate results along the way: this
                project is educational, and we want to help students to
                understand what is happening!

            <li> Students should be able to generate their own input to
                experiment with the algorithms as easily as the language
                allows.
