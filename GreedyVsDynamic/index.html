                <b>Abstract:</b>
                A point of puzzlement for many students studying algorithms
                is when, exactly, one can apply a greedy algorithm to
                a problem, and when one must use the more complicated
                and time-consuming techniques of dynamic programming.
                This paper suggestions that the existing pedagogical
                literature does not offer clear guidance on this
                issue. Furthermore, we suggest how computer science
                pedagogy might be improved by importing a concept
                economists use in the context of dynamic programming.
                That concept is "opportunity cost," and we explain
                how it can aid students in differentiating "greedy
                cases" from situations requiring dynamic programing.

                Introduction
            </h3>

            <p>
                This paper aims to show that, while the distinction between
                static and dynamic allocation problems, based on
                the periods in which the opportunity costs
                of a choice falls, is
                well-understood in economics, the idea is not as clear in
                computer science. And what's more, we suggest
                that the computer science literature, especially
                the pedagogical literature, could benefit from
                incorporating this distinction.
                Here, for instance, is the way
                the today's top algorithm textbook describes
                when a greedy algorithm may be used:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                How can we tell whether a greedy algorithm will solve
                a particular optmization problem? No way works all the
                time, but the greedy-choice property and optimal
                substructure are the two key ingredients. If we can
                demonstrate that the problem has these properties,
                then we are well on our way to developing a greedy 
                algorithm for it. (CLRS, p. 424)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
            The economists' idea of the <i>opportunity cost</i>
            of a choice can help clarify this situation.
            The opportunity cost of a choice is the most highly
            valued opportunity that was (or will be) foregone
            in the making of the choice. For instance, we might be on the
            fence between going to Bangkok or to Paris for our vacation.
            If, in the end, we choose Bangkok, then the opportunity cost
            of the choice is the vacation to Paris that we are not
            taking.
            </p>

            <p>
            There are choices for which the opportunity cost is entirely
            contained in the moment of choice: if I am choosing between
            blueberry and apple pie, the cost I incur in choosing apple
            may be only not enjoying a slice of blueberry pie: we can 
            imagine the two choices cost the same amount of money, contain
            the same number of calories, have the same amount of sugar,
            and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
            On the other hand, if I am choosing between a slice of pie
            and a plate of broccoli, I may want to consider future effects.
            I may enjoy the pie more at the moment, but later regret
            its effect on my weight, or on my blood sugar levels.
            The opportunity cost of choosing the pie now is <i>not</i>
            just forgoing the broccoli, but also includes the weight
            gain and blood sugar effects that will only occur in a future
            "period."
            </p>

            <p>
            The first example is one in which a greedy algorithm 
            can be used: we simply choose the flavor of pie
            we prefer, since the future impact of either choice
            is identical. There is no need to consider other
            periods.
            On the other hand, when the opportunity cost spills over into
            future periods, as in the pie versus broccoli example,
            we must resort to dynamic programming.
            </p>

                The Treatment of This Topic in the Economic Literature
            </h3>

            <p>
            Ferguson and Lim (2007) capture this idea in their distinction
            between static and dynamic consumption problems:
            </p>

            <blockquote> 
                In a static consumption problem the opportunity cost of
                spending an amount of money buy a unit of one commodity (and
                deriving the marginal utility associated with consuming one
                more unit of that commodity) is the
                largest extra utility would
                have derived from spending money some other on some other
                commodity. In a dynamic problem the opportunity cost of
                spending today is the largest extra
                lifetime utility we could
                have derived from saving the money and spending it at some
                point in the future.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                In their terms, when we have a static consumption problem
                (i.e., the opportunity cost is confined
                to the current period),
                we can use a greedy algorithm. When the
                opportunity cost must be
                considered over future periods, we must resort
                to a more complicated technique, such as dynamic
                programming.
            </p>


            <h3>
                The Treatment of This Topic in the 
                Computer Science Literature
            </h3>

            <p>
                The concept of opportunity cost is not unknown
                in the computer science literature. For instance,
                Amir et al. (1998) and Borgstrom (2000) employ
                it to analyze job scheduling problems in a metacomputer.
                Pillac et al. (2011) employ the concept in analyzing
                vehicle routing problems.
                (Cite other examples.)
                Nevertheless, we have not been able to find an instance
                in the computer science literature of opportunity cost
                being used to clarify when a greedy algorithm may be
                used and when we must turn to dynamic programming.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lew comes close to stating the economist's distinction,
                but with less clarity:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                Informally, a "greedy" optimization algorithm
                solves a global minimization or maximization problem
                by making a sequence of locally optimal decisions. A
                decision is "local" or "myopic" if it is based on
                partial information that does
                not include global knowledge about future
                consequences of current decisions
                (Heyman and Sobel, 1984); thus, the current
                decision, once made, might turn out
                to be nonoptimal. (Lew 2006, p. 621)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Lew later states:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                While we lack a general procedure to
                determine whether or not a
                canonical greedy algorithm is optimal,
                no general procedure exists
                for noncanonical greedy algorithms either.
            </blockquote>
