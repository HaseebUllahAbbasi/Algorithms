"""
This file contains Python implementations of sorting algorithms from
Intro to Algorithms (Cormen et al.)
The aim here is not efficient Python implementations (we'd just call
the native sort if we wanted that) but to duplicate the pseudo-code
in the book as closely as possible.
Also, since the goal is to help students to see how the algorithm
works, there are print statements placed at key points in the code.
I have been helped by code from http://interactivepython.org/
in creating these examples.
The performance of each function is stated in the docstring, and
loop invariants are expressed as assert statements when they
are not too complex.
This file contains:
    insert_sort()
    merge_sort()
    bubble_sort()
    And auxilliary functions that these sorts use, such as
        swap().
