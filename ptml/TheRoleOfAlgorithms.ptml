      <b>What's an algorithm?</b>
      A carefully written recipe.<br>
      We need to agree what steps are allowed in a recipe.<br>
      We need to agree what problem the recipe is solving, ahead of time.<br>

    Termination
    </summary>

    <p>
          On any legal (meaning, consistent with algorithm specification) input,
        the procedure you are describing should
        always eventually stop, or <i>terminate</i>.
        (In this course we will not talk about
        algorithms that are intended to run "forever,"
        such as the scheduler in an operating system.)

    <summary class="sum2">
    Correctness
    </summary>

    <p>
        On any legal input, provided the procedure has terminated,
        the result that it produces has to be correct. Not <em>sometimes</em> correct,
        not <em>mostly</em> correct, but <em>always</em> correct.

    Performance
    </summary>

    <p>
        You can measure performance in many different ways.
        The course will focus on the running time,
        but there are many others:
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                space (memory use)
            </li>
            <li>
                disk use, amount of disk-memory communication
            </li>
            <li>
                number of processors in a parallel program
            </li>
            <li>
                total amount of work in a parallel program
            </li>
            <li>
                number of cores in a multi-core program
            </li>
            <li>
                total amount of communication in a distributed program
            </li>
            <li>
                power consumed in an algorithm tuned to low-power devices
            </li>
            <li>
                many others
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
    
          So in short, when you describe a recipe for doing something,
          make sure it always stops,
          make sure it always produces correct answers,
          and only after that worry about how
          efficient it is. (Depending on the algorithm,
          some or all of these are very
          easy, and some may not be obvious at all. We will see examples later.)
