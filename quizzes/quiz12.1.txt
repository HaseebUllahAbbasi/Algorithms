Suppose the numbers 7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2 are inserted in that order into an initially empty binary search tree. The binary search tree uses the usual ordering on natural numbers. What is the in-order traversal sequence of the resultant tree?#8 9 4 6 2 3 0 1 5 7#^0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9#0 2 4 3 1 6 5 9 7 8#7 5 1 0 3 2 4 6 8 9
Given a binary search tree, which traversal type would print the values in the nodes in sorted order?#None of the above#Postorder#Preorder#^Inorder
Preorder and in order of a tree is given Inorder â€” D H B E A I F C J G Preorder -- A B D H E C F I G J K. What will be the post order traversal of the tree?#H D E B F I J K G C A#^H D E B I F J K G C A#H D E B I F J K C G A#None of the above
