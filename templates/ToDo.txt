Algorithm Museum To-Do List
_____________________________________

ALL: All code should be stored in a single file named for the chapter in CLRS
for which it implements the algorithms, OR it should be in a directory with
such a name, if there is more than one file for the code. So, if the C source
code for chapter 4 is in a single file, it should be called
divide_and_conquer.c.

ALL: Write tests for each algorithm you have implemented.
