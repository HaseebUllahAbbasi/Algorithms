            <li>Write pseudo-code for a double hasing scheme. You may simply
                call your hashing functions h1() and h2(). (In other words, you
                needn't actually write the hashing functions.)

            <li>What operations do we want in the ADT <em>iterator</em>?
                Consider including rewind() in the ADT: is it always going to
                be possible to implement it? If "no," in which situations
                would it not be possible?
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Get iterator.
                    <li>Get next value.
                    <li>Detect end of iterables.
                </ul>

                Can't rewind if data is gone, e.g., live stock feed.

            <li>Let us say we have an algorithm that runs in 8(lg n) + 10 time.
                We want to show its order of complexity is &theta;(lg n). Give
                an example of a set of k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>,
                and n<sub>0</sub> that would do this, so that k<sub>1</sub>
                * lg n < 8(lg n) + 10 < k<sub>2</sub> * lg n.
                <br> <br> <br> <br> 
                Example values:

                <br>
                n<sub>0</sub> = 2048

            <li>Imagine you have an 8-sided die, numbered 1 through 8. Use an
                indicator random variable to show how many 8s we expect to get
                in 100 rolls.

            <li>Draw the binary search tree that arises from inserting, in
                order:
                24, 32, 10, 6, 88, 20, 28, 22, 1, 99

            <li>In the above tree, describe the process by which we find the
                successor of 22.
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
            <li>Use an indicator random variable to show how many numbers we
                have to pick from a set of <em>n</em> numbers before we are
                more likely than not to have drawn the same number twice.

            <li>Write pseudo-code for a hash table (you can just assume a hash
                function of h) that resolves collisions by chaining, and that
                looks up (possibly chained) key value and returns the
                associated data.

                    Write memoized pseudo-code that uses recursion, but also
                    uses a direct addressing to store results.
